       <p><strong>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong></p>
       <p>When I first accessed this interaction website, the exhibition advertising banner in the front attracted me.<br>
          Moreover, large photos uploaded to promote exhibitions on NGV attract website users to take an interesting look at the exhibitions.<br>
          I clicked on the photo of the exhibition I was most interested in, and at the same time, it was convenient to link to a web page with well-organised information about the exhibition.<br>
          The first thing I felt when I experienced the NGV website was that it was designed to make it convenient and easy for users to find the information about the exhibition they wanted without spending a lot of energy and time.
       </p>
      
       <p><strong>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</strong></p>
       <p>Below is a list of actions on the NGV website that I experienced for two minutes.<br>
         1. I first accessed this website and clicked on a photo of Alexander McQueen that was heavily advertised on the front.<br>
         2. After clicking on the photo, promotional videos of the Alexander McQueen exhibition came out, and I became more curious about this exhibition.<br>
         3. When I scroll down the web page after the video, the language selection button for an explanation of the exhibition, the ticket purchase button, the scrolling window for the ticket price, and the ticket purchase button for NGV members are aligned in the middle of the web page.<br>
         4. After setting the language with a simple button, I looked up the exhibition period and ticket price, which I was curious about.<br>
         5. After obtaining information about the exhibition, I used the navigation at the top of the website to click the "Join" button to go to the web page for membership.<br>
         6. On the "Join" web page, the membership sign-up button, the button to explain the benefits of being a member, the event list button for the members, and the description of Terms and Conditions were arranged at a glance.<br>
         7. Using the navigation at the top of the website, we went to the "Shop" webpage this time.<br>
         8. At the top of the "Shop" page, there was a large photo promoting the Alexander McQueen Memorial Book, and a "Shop now" button was placed in the middle of the picture to design a webpage for users to purchase quickly. In addition, a banner was designed to make links with images such as "New in" and "Books" so that users can easily shop for the souvenirs they want.</p>
 
       <p><strong>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</strong></p>
       <p>The part that I spent the most time experiencing on the NGV website was reading the detailed description of the exhibition.<br>
          The exhibition description was written in white letters on a black background, but I was used to black letters on a white background, so the white letters on a black background made my eyes tired.<br>
          Moreover, the exhibition explanation was longer than I wanted, making it difficult to grasp the contents, and it made me weary that there was no distinction between paragraphs.<br>
          I felt the importance of creating a familiar environment so that users could easily and quickly understand without spending too much time.</p>
      
       <p><strong>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</strong></p>
       <p>The most common behaviour when experiencing the NGV website was clicking the button and using the mouse hover.<br> 
          This is because NGV websites are designed to interact so users can obtain information efficiently.<br>
          As can be seen in the video below, the user can easily move to the desired page with one button.<br>
          <video src="video/img2.mp4" width="250" height="500" controls>
       </p>
       <br>
       <p><strong>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</strong></p>
       <p>The impression of primary goal of NGV website I experienced was efficiently communicating exhibition information and content to website users to promote and inform NGV's exhibitions.<br>
          In addition, it is designed to make it easy for users to recognise and enjoy information and interaction.<br>
          For example, video, mouse hover, prominent button placement, links to get the information users to want right away by clicking on the pictures, and navigation at the top help users maintain interest through easy recognition when exploring a website.</p>
   
       <p><strong>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</strong></p>
       <p>As mentioned above, the NGV website designed videos, mouse hovers, prominent button placement, links to get the information you want right away when you click on photos, and navigation at the top to provide users with convenience and interest when exploring the website.<br>
          And the overall website colour used achromatic colours and gothic letters, making it a simple feeling, which seems to be a design that helps users quickly find the information they want.<br>
          The basic website was designed not to be flashy, and the exhibition was highlighted and promoted by placing many photos and videos of the products and exhibitions that wanted to be promoted.<br>
          As NGV website is an art museum's website, many users interact to search for exhibition information. Therefore, designers think they are designed to be easy for many users to recognise rather than displaying their characteristics.</p>
      
       <p><strong>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</strong></p>
     
       <p><strong>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</strong></p>
      
       <ul>
       <p><li><h3><strong>Week3</strong></h3></li></p>
       </ul>

       <p><strong>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</strong></p>
       
       <p><strong>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</strong></p>
    
       <p><strong>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</strong></p>
   
       <p><strong>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</strong></p>
   
       <p><strong>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</strong></p>
