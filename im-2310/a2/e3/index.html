  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
    I made the text in the box easy for users to recognise. 
    And when the mouse cursor is placed on the box, the shape changes to a pointer. 
    It is set up to interact with users, making it easier to recognise as a clickable button.

  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
     I changed the cursor shape to "Waiting" to show the interaction that the page is working while waiting for the user to click the button and go to the Hosono page.
     In addition, I extended the user's patience by providing animation effects so that the user does not get bored while waiting for the page to turn.

  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
     I changed the shape of the mouse cursor to a "pointer" to allow users to interact with the numbered lists as a clickable list. 
     Users will know that the lists are clickable when they place their cursor over the text and notice that it changes to a "pointer".

  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
     I set up an interactive text "for your convenience" that explains how users can change the screen mode according to their taste when viewing the screen.
     And I made a box and the font bigger so that users can clearly recognise it as a button.

  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition
     I added the transition CSS property to make it inherited by all elements, especially mouse hover and active effects, so users can interact with Hosono photos.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
